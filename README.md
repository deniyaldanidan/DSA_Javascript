# Big-O Notation
The Big-O notation measures the worst-case complexity of an algorithm. In Big-O notation, n represents the number of inputs. The question asked with Big-O is the following: “What will happen as n approaches infinity?” When you implement an algorithm, Big-O notation is important because it tells you how efficient the algorithm is. 

### What is the best possible solution?
- Minimum amount of code?
- Best Performance?
- Least Memory usage?
